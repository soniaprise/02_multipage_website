**Refactor previous project to make it a multi-page website**

-   Make every section of the webpage to be a separate page (a separate HTML file), so you will have something like:

    * index.html with the home page (the splash screen)
    * location.html with the Location section and a map
    * team.html with images of the team
    * brands.html with the content of the brands section
    * gallery.html with the gallery images

-   Every page should have the topbar with navigation and the footer

You donâ€™t need to create any functionality, just purely presentational copy of all the page elements.
